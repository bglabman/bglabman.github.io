		<div class="about">
			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I grew up in Newport Beach, California, and am a recent graduate of the University of Oregon. I majored in Business Administration and minored in Economics.

I am a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, UO Sales Club, UO Comedy Club, Grooop, and the University of Oregon Student Mental Health Advocates Group.

I am passionate about travel and learning about other cultures. I have recently completed a work-study at Encess Japan in Chuo, Tokyo, Japan during summer 2019. I hope to have opportunities in my future career to travel to other countries.

In terms of personal interests, I love to create music and art, go to the beach, and eat food. 

If you have any questions, donâ€™t hesitate to reach out.
