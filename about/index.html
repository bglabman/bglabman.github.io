			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I grew up in Newport Beach, California, and am a graduate of the University of Oregon. My passions include traveling, creating music & art, and trying new things. During the summer of 2019, I completed a work-study at Encess Japan in Chuo, Tokyo, Japan. I hope to have opportunities in my future career to travel to other countries.
