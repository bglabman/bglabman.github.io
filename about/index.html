		<div class="about">
			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I grew up in Newport Beach, California, and am a recent graduate of the University of Oregon. I majored in Business and minored in Economics.

While at school, I was a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, UO Sales Club, UO Comedy Club, Grooop, and the University of Oregon Student Mental Health Advocates Group.

My passions include traveling, learning about other cultures, and trying new things. During the summer of 2019, I completed a work-study at Encess Japan in Chuo, Tokyo, Japan. I hope to have opportunities in my future career to travel to other countries.

My interests include creating music and art, going to the beach, and eating good food.
